# Regularity Index

Regularity index quantifies routines in participant behaviours by capturing the similarity (or difference) in participant behaviours between the same hours across different days. For internet connectivity, for instance, the regularity index quantifies the routineness of the participantâ€™s internet connectivity behaviour at the same hours (eg, every 9 am) for all days(1,2).

This reposition is an implementation of the algorithm as described in the following reference publications
